##  Code Overview
Libraries Used:

 -OpenCV: For video capture and image processing.
 -MediaPipe: For hand tracking and landmark detection.
 -NumPy: For mathematical operations.

Main Components:

 -Video Capture: Captures video from the webcam.
 -Hand Detection: Detects and tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
 -Enemy Movement: Randomly positions the enemy on the screen.
 -Collision Detection: Checks for proximity between the player's finger and enemy to update the score.

Game Logic:

 -Continuously captures and processes video frames.
 -Updates score when the player's finger touches an enemy.
 -Moves enemies to new positions when caught.


## Concepts Used

 -Computer Vision: Real-time processing with OpenCV.
 -Hand Tracking: MediaPipe for detecting hand landmarks.
 -Game Mechanics: Score tracking and interaction through gesture recognition

## Challenges Faced

 -Real-time Processing: Optimizing performance for smooth gameplay.
 -Lighting Conditions: Ensuring accurate tracking in different lighting environments.
 -Coordinate Mapping: Mapping hand positions to screen coordinates accurately.
